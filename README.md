# Care Connect

Welcome to CareConnect. The goal of the app is to connect Psychiatrists and Patients to allow for Psychiatrists to check up on patients while they are at home. Additionally, the app proactively checks up on the patient with the data it collects to detect abnormal behaviors in the patients to notify the psychiatrists and schedule an appointment. Lastly, this app was submitted for the Congressional App Challenge 2024.

## Coding Overview

We utilized Swift to code on XCode to develop the iOS App. Additionally, we connected our system with the Google Firebase Database to keep track of authentication(register/login), profile pictures, and user data. Lastly, we utilized the OpenAI API to provide messaging features for patients looking to talk when there is no available Psychiatrist to do so. We also implemented the Google Location API to provide location services and direct users to new psychiatrists that are closest to them.
