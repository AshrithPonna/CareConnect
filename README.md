Welcome to CareConnect. The goal of the app is to connect Psychiatrists and Patients to allow for Psychiatrists to check up on patients while they are at home. Additionally, the app proactively checks up on the patient with the data it collects to detect abnormal behaviors in the patients to notify the psychiatrists and schedule an appointment. The main overarching goal of this product is to effectively allow individuals with mental health needs to have an effective sourc of access to medical professionals, allowing them to feel at ease on a continuous basis. Lastly, this app was submitted for the Congressional App Challenge 2024.

## Coding Overview

We utilized **Swift** to code on **XCode** to develop the **iOS App**. Additionally, we connected our system with the **Google Firebase Database** to keep track of authentication(register/login), profile pictures, and user data. Lastly, we utilized the **OpenAI API** to provide messaging features for patients looking to talk when there is no available Psychiatrist to do so. We also implemented the Google Location API to provide location services and direct users to new psychiatrists that are closest to them. On a generalized basis, the crediting aspect of our softward on the basis of AI goes to OpenAI due to their intensive resourceful API integration.
